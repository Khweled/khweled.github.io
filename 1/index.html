    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p> Early in 1900's a Russian photographer, Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii, attempted to make color photos by
        taking three exposures through red, green and blue filters stacked one ontop of another. The goal of this
        project is to create a procedure to automatically align each of these images to create a single color image with
        as little errors in alignment as possible.
    </p>

    <h3> Basic Alignment </h3>

    <p> The most straightforward way to align these images is to have some heuristic, and take the best score from all
        possible ways to overlay the channels. This is very slow, we can do better. Since the images are already mostly
        aligned we can search through a smaller displacement window and use the best score in that window. For the
        heuristic we can take the summed squared errors of every pixel value and the lower the score the better the
        displacement. Below are the results from this method.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3> Image Pyramid </h3>

    <p> For larger images the basic method is too slow, since the window we would need to search over can be hundreds of
        pixels. A better way would be to rescale the images and do the basic alignment on the downscaled image. This
        means if I rescaled an image down to 1/8th its original size, every pixel I cover will be 8 pixels in the
        original image. With this knowledge we can find the best displacement for each rescaled image, and propagate
        this displacment up our image pyramid to start the search from a more informed position. Not only does this
        greatly increase performance but it also greatly increases the quality of the image as shown below.

    <h3> A Better Heuristic </h3>

    <p> Using the raw pixel values has a major downfall, what if a large portion of the image is either red,
        green, or blue? In the case of our friend Emir here, his clothes are mostly blue which means that we
        might have some problems attempting to align his picture. One solution is to do edge dectection on the
        image. Edge dectection finds the edges of objects in an image and outlines them. Using the edges of our
        subject we can much better align his body and the background to their true displacement. I used canny
        edge dectction, found in the skimage library, for simple and quick edge detection. While this did hurt
        performance, in the end it led to greatly increased picture quality.

    </div>


    <h3> Automatic Cropping </h3>

    <p> From all the examples from above the borders of our image dont particularly look very nice, in order to fix this
        I implemented automatic cropping. The basic idea is to use edge detection on the borders of an image (about the
        outer 10% of the image) and find straight lines along the edge and crop the image there. In order to find the
        best cropping I use several values to tweak the edge detection to be smoother or more granular, and I take the
        maximum ammount of cropping and use that in the final result.
