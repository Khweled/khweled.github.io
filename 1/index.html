    <h1 align="center">Images of the Russian Empire: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection</h1>
    <p>This projects goal is to align the red, green, and blue color channels of images. The images that I have used
        were taken in early 1900s Russia. These photos were taken on black and white film but with a red, green and blue
        filter over the camera in order to only capture the light of that color. This was achived by taking three
        exposures, one ontop of another, to later be laid one ontop of another for true color images. Due to this
        procedure the photos are not always 100% aligned. Here I will describe my procedure for automatically aligning
        these images.</p>
